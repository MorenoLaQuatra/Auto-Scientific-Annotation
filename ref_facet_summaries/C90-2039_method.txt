This is unnecessary because there are often input snbgraphs that can be used as part of the result graph without any modification, or as sharable parts between one of the input graphs and the result graph. Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying. A better method would nfinimize the copying of sharable varts. in this method, theretbre, the failure tendency information is acquired by a learning process. That is, the SING unification method applied in an analysis system uses the failure tendency information acquired by a learning analysis process. in the learning process, when FS unification is applied, feature treatment orders are randomized for the sake of random extraction. Furthermore, structure sharing increases the portion of token identical substructures of FSs which makes it efficient to keep unification results of substructures of FSs and reuse them.
