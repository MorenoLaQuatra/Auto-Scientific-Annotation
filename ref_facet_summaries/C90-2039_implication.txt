itowever, the problem with his method is that a unitication result graph consists only of newly created structures. This is unnecessary because there are often input snbgraphs that can be used as part of the result graph without any modification, or as sharable parts between one of the input graphs and the result graph. Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying. A better method would nfinimize the copying of sharable varts. Furthermore, structure sharing increases the portion of token identical substructures of FSs which makes it efficient to keep unification results of substructures of FSs and reuse them.
