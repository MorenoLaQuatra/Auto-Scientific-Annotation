Foma is largely compatible with the Xerox/PARC finite-state toolkit. Foma is a finite-state compiler, programming language, and regular expression/finite-state library designed for multipurpose use with explicit support for automata theoretic research, constructing lexical analyzers for programming languages, and building morphological/phonological analyzers, as well as spellchecking applications. Foma is licensed under the GNU general public license: in keeping with traditions of free software, the distribution that includes the source code comes with a user manual and a library of examples. This makes it straightforward to build spell-checkers from morphological transducers by simply extracting the range of the transduction and matching words approximately. Though the main concern with Foma has not been that of efficiency, but of compatibility and extendibility, from a usefulness perspective it is important to avoid bottlenecks in the underlying algorithms that can cause compilation times to skyrocket, especially when constructing and combining large lexical transducers.
