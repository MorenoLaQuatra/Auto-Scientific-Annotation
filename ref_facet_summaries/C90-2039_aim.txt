Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying. 5 disables structure sharing, ttowever, this whole copying is not necessary if a lazy evaluation method is used. Furthermore, structure sharing increases the portion of token identical substructures of FSs which makes it efficient to keep unification results of substructures of FSs and reuse them. This reduces repeated calculation of substructures.
