The algorithm is based on a graph model representing words and relationships between them. Sense clusters are iteratively computed by clustering the local graph of similar words around an ambiguous word. Following the method in (Widdows and Dorow, 2002), we build a graph in which each node represents a noun and two nodes have an edge between them if they co-occur in lists more than a given number of times 1. To detect the different areas of meaning in our local graphs, we use a cluster algorithm for graphs (Markov clustering, MCL) developed by van Dongen (2000).
