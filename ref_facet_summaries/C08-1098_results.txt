We present a HMM part-of-speech tagging method which is particularly suited for POS tagsets with a large number of fine-grained tags. Tagsets of this size contain little or no information about number, gender, case and similar morphosyntac- tic features. For languages with a rich morphology such as German or Czech, more fine-grained tagsets are often considered more appropriate. The German Tiger treebank (Brants et al., 2002) is an example of a corpus with a more fine-grained tagset (over 700 tags overall). It is annotated with POS tags from the coarse-grained STTS tagset and with additional features encoding information about number, gender, case, person, degree, tense, and mood. 3 9 97.57 97.97 Table 3: STTS accuracies of the TnT tagger trained on the STTS tagset, the TnT tagger trained on the Tiger tagset, and our tagger trained on the Tiger tagset.
