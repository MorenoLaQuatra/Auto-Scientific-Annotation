Tagsets of this size contain little or no information about number, gender, case and similar morphosyntac- tic features. For languages with a rich morphology such as German or Czech, more fine-grained tagsets are often considered more appropriate. It is annotated with POS tags from the coarse-grained STTS tagset and with additional features encoding information about number, gender, case, person, degree, tense, and mood.
