We present a HMM part-of-speech tagging method which is particularly suited for POS tagsets with a large number of fine-grained tags. Tagsets of this size contain little or no information about number, gender, case and similar morphosyntac- tic features. Our tagger generates a predictor for each feature (such as base POS, number, gender etc.) Instead of using a single tree for the prediction of all possible values of a feature (such as noun, article, etc. for base POS), the tagger builds a separate decision tree for each value. Our tagger is a HMM tagger which decomposes the context probabilities into a product of attribute probabilities. The tagger may use an external lexicon which supplies entries for additional words which are not found in the training corpus, and additional tags for words which did occur in the training data. 3 9 97.57 97.97 Table 3: STTS accuracies of the TnT tagger trained on the STTS tagset, the TnT tagger trained on the Tiger tagset, and our tagger trained on the Tiger tagset. We presented a HMM POS tagger for fine-grained tagsets which splits the POS tags into attribute vectors and estimates the conditional probabilities of the attributes with decision trees.
