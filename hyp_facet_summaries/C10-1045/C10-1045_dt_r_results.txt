First, we identify sources of syntactic ambiguity understudied in the existing parsing literature. Finally, we show that in application settings, the absence of gold segmentation lowers parsing performance by 2–5% F1. It is well-known that constituency parsing models designed for English often do not generalize easily to other languages and treebanks.1 Explanations for this phenomenon have included the relative informativeness of lexicalization (Dubey and Keller, 2003; Arun and Keller, 2005), insensitivity to morphology (Cowan and Collins, 2005; Tsarfaty and Sima’an, 2008), and the effect of variable word order (Collins et al., 1999). But diacritics are not present in unvocalized text, which is the standard form of, e.g., news media documents.3 VBD she added VP PUNC S VP VBP NP ... As a result, Arabic sentences are usually long relative to English, especially after Length English (WSJ) Arabic (ATB) ≤ 20 41.9% 33.7% ≤ 40 92.4% 73.2% ≤ 63 99.7% 92.6% ≤ 70 99.9% 94.9% Table 2: Frequency distribution for sentence lengths in the WSJ (sections 2–23) and the ATB (p1–3). We show that noun-noun vs. discourse-level coordination ambiguity in Arabic is a significant source of parsing errors (Table 8c). of Arabic. This PCFG is incorporated into the Stanford Parser, a factored model that chooses a 1-best parse from the product of constituency and dependency parses. 01 75. 97 78. 35 76. 87 Table 7: Test set results. (2003), which gives 96.8% accuracy on the test set. Our baseline for all sentence lengths is 5.23% F1 higher than the best previous result. The ATB annotation distinguishes between verbal and nominal readings of maSdar process nominals. pre-processing. The errors shown are from the Berkeley parser output, but they are representative of the other two parsing models. Table 9 shows that MADA produces a high quality segmentation, and that the effect of cascading segmentation errors on parsing is only 1.92% F1. Our results suggest that current parsing models would benefit from better annotation consistency and enriched annotation in certain syntactic configurations. Further,
