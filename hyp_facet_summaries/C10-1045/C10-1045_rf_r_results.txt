First, we identify sources of syntactic ambiguity understudied in the existing parsing literature. Finally, we show that in application settings, the absence of gold segmentation lowers parsing performance by 2–5% F1. For parsing, the most challenging form of ambiguity occurs at the discourse level. A defining characteristic of MSA is the prevalence of discourse markers to connect and subordinate words and phrases (Ryding, 2005). As a result, Arabic sentences are usually long relative to English, especially after Length English (WSJ) Arabic (ATB) ≤ 20 41.9% 33.7% ≤ 40 92.4% 73.2% ≤ 63 99.7% 92.6% ≤ 70 99.9% 94.9% Table 2: Frequency distribution for sentence lengths in the WSJ (sections 2–23) and the ATB (p1–3). The resulting structural differences between tree- banks can account for relative differences in parsing performance. of Arabic. This PCFG is incorporated into the Stanford Parser, a factored model that chooses a 1-best parse from the product of constituency and dependency parses. For example, we might have VP → VB NP PP, where the NP is the subject. 40 75. Modifying the Berkeley parser for Arabic is straightforward. The Berkeley parser gives state-of-the-art performance for all metrics. The errors shown are from the Berkeley parser output, but they are representative of the other two parsing models. Until now, all evaluations of Arabic parsing—including the experiments in the previous section—have assumed gold segmentation. But gold segmentation is not available in application settings, so a segmenter and parser are arranged in a pipeline. ∗NP NP PP R) and ∗NP NP ADJP R) are both iDafa attachment. Table 9 shows that MADA produces a high quality segmentation, and that the effect of cascading segmentation errors on parsing is only 1.92% F1. By establishing significantly higher parsing baselines, we have shown that Arabic parsing performance is not as poor as previously thought, but remains much lower than English. We have described grammar state splits that significantly improve parsing performance, catalogued parsing errors, and quantified the effect of segmentation errors. pre-processing.
