Fourth, we show how to build better models for three different parsers. The distinctions in the ATB are linguistically justified, but complicate parsing. Diacritics can also be used to specify grammatical relations such as case and gender. We propose a limit of 70 words for Arabic parsing evaluations. segmentation (Table 2). Manual annotation results in human in- terpretable grammars that can inform future tree- bank annotation decisions. with the number of exactly matching guess trees. 6 Joint Segmentation and Parsing. Since these are distinct syntactic units, they are typically segmented. The ATB segmentation scheme is one of many alternatives. Until now, all evaluations of Arabic parsing—including the experiments in the previous section—have assumed gold segmentation. But gold segmentation is not available in application settings, so a segmenter and parser are arranged in a pipeline. Segmentation errors cascade into the parsing phase, placing an artificial limit on parsing performance. input token, the segmentation is then performed deterministically given the 1-best analysis. But we follow the more direct adaptation of Evalb suggested by Tsarfaty (2006), who viewed exact segmentation as the ultimate goal. Table 9 shows that MADA produces a high quality segmentation, and that the effect of cascading segmentation errors on parsing is only 1.92% F1. In these experiments, the input lacks segmentation markers, hence the slightly different dev set baseline than in Table 6. We have described grammar state splits that significantly improve parsing performance, catalogued parsing errors, and quantified the effect of segmentation errors. 95
