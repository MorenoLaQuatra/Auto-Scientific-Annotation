First, we identify sources of syntactic ambiguity understudied in the existing parsing literature. Finally, we show that in application settings, the absence of gold segmentation lowers parsing performance by 2–5% F1. Next we show that the ATB is similar to other tree- banks in gross statistical terms, but that annotation consistency remains low relative to English (§3). To facilitate comparison with previous work, we exhaustively evaluate this grammar and two other parsing models when gold segmentation is assumed (§5). We show that noun-noun vs. discourse-level coordination ambiguity in Arabic is a significant source of parsing errors (Table 8c). Instead, we extend the variation n-gram method of Dickinson (2005) to compare annotation error rates in the WSJ and ATB. of Arabic. This PCFG is incorporated into the Stanford Parser, a factored model that chooses a 1-best parse from the product of constituency and dependency parses. For example, we might have VP → VB NP PP, where the NP is the subject. Modifying the Berkeley parser for Arabic is straightforward. The Berkeley parser gives state-of-the-art performance for all metrics. The errors shown are from the Berkeley parser output, but they are representative of the other two parsing models. But gold segmentation is not available in application settings, so a segmenter and parser are arranged in a pipeline. Segmentation errors cascade into the parsing phase, placing an artificial limit on parsing performance. (a) Of the high frequency phrasal categories, ADJP and SBAR are the hardest to parse. ∗NP NP PP R) and ∗NP NP ADJP R) are both iDafa attachment. Table 9 shows that MADA produces a high quality segmentation, and that the effect of cascading segmentation errors on parsing is only 1.92% F1. By establishing significantly higher parsing baselines, we have shown that Arabic parsing performance is not as poor as previously thought, but remains much lower than English. We have described grammar state splits that significantly improve parsing performance, catalogued parsing errors, and quantified the effect of segmentation errors. 3.
