1 The apparent difficulty of adapting constituency models to non-configurational languages has been one motivation for dependency representations (Hajicˇ and Zema´nek, 2004; Habash and Roth, 2009). Crucially, the conventional orthographic form of MSA text is unvocalized, a property that results in a deficient graphical representation. For humans, this characteristic can impede the acquisition of literacy. Finally, we provide a realistic eval uation in which segmentation is performed both in a pipeline and jointly with parsing (§6). We quantify error categories in both evaluation settings. The distinctions in the ATB are linguistically justified, but complicate parsing. Gabbard and Kulick (2008) show that there is significant attachment ambiguity associated with iDafa, which occurs in 84.3% of the trees in our development set. For parsing, the most challenging form of ambiguity occurs at the discourse level. Arabic sentences of up to length 63 would need to be. segmentation (Table 2). Following Dickinson (2005), we randomly sampled 100 variation nuclei from each corpus and evaluated each sample for the presence of an annotation error. The 95% confidence intervals for type-level errors are (5580, 9440) for the ATB and (1400, 4610) for the WSJ. In our grammar, features are realized as annotations to basic category labels. Base NPs are the other significant category of nominal phrases. It has no syntactic function. 40 75. 30 75. pre-processing. 6 Joint Segmentation and Parsing. Since these are distinct syntactic units, they are typically segmented. The ATB segmentation scheme is one of many alternatives. Particles
