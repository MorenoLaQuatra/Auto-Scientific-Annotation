Finally, we show that in application settings, the absence of gold segmentation lowers parsing performance by 2–5% F1. It is well-known that constituency parsing models designed for English often do not generalize easily to other languages and treebanks.1 Explanations for this phenomenon have included the relative informativeness of lexicalization (Dubey and Keller, 2003; Arun and Keller, 2005), insensitivity to morphology (Cowan and Collins, 2005; Tsarfaty and Sima’an, 2008), and the effect of variable word order (Collins et al., 1999). As a result, Arabic sentences are usually long relative to English, especially after Length English (WSJ) Arabic (ATB) ≤ 20 41.9% 33.7% ≤ 40 92.4% 73.2% ≤ 63 99.7% 92.6% ≤ 70 99.9% 94.9% Table 2: Frequency distribution for sentence lengths in the WSJ (sections 2–23) and the ATB (p1–3). 6. 3) all G o l d P O S 7 0 0.7 91 0.825 358 0.7 73 0.818 358 0.8 02 0.836 452 80. 6 Joint Segmentation and Parsing.

Table 9 shows that MADA produces a high quality segmentation, and that the effect of cascading segmentation errors on parsing is only 1.92% F1. ATB
