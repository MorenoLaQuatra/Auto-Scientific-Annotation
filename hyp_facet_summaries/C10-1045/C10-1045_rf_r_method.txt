Fourth, we show how to build better models for three different parsers. 1 The apparent difficulty of adapting constituency models to non-configurational languages has been one motivation for dependency representations (Hajicˇ and Zema´nek, 2004; Habash and Roth, 2009). How should the absence of vowels and syntactic markers influence annotation choices and grammar development? Diacritics can also be used to specify grammatical relations such as case and gender. segmentation (Table 2). Following Dickinson (2005), we randomly sampled 100 variation nuclei from each corpus and evaluated each sample for the presence of an annotation error. 40 75. with the number of exactly matching guess trees. We include a list of per-category results for selected phrasal labels, POS tags, and dependencies in Table 8. 6 Joint Segmentation and Parsing. The ATB segmentation scheme is one of many alternatives. But gold segmentation is not available in application settings, so a segmenter and parser are arranged in a pipeline. Lattice parsing (Chappelier et al., 1999) is an alternative to a pipeline that prevents cascading errors by placing all segmentation options into the parse chart. Aside from adding a simple rule to correct alif deletion caused by the preposition J, no other language-specific processing is performed. Our evaluation includes both weighted and un- weighted lattices. input token, the segmentation is then performed deterministically given the 1-best analysis. Table 9 shows that MADA produces a high quality segmentation, and that the effect of cascading segmentation errors on parsing is only 1.92% F1. 37
