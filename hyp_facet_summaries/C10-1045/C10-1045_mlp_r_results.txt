Better Arabic Parsing: Baselines, Evaluations, and Analysis In this paper, we offer broad insight into the underperformance of Arabic constituency parsing by analyzing the interplay of linguistic phenomena, annotation choices, and model design. First, we identify sources of syntactic ambiguity understudied in the existing parsing literature. Second, we show that although the Penn Arabic Treebank is similar to other tree- banks in gross statistical terms, annotation consistency remains problematic. Finally, we show that in application settings, the absence of gold segmentation lowers parsing performance by 2–5% F1. To investigate the influence of these factors, we analyze Modern Standard Arabic (henceforth MSA, or simply “Arabic”) because of the unusual opportunity it presents for comparison to English parsing results. The Penn Arabic Treebank (ATB) syntactic guidelines (Maamouri et al., 2004) were purposefully borrowed without major modification from English (Marcus et al., 1993). 29 — 95. 07 95. 3.
