Better Arabic Parsing: Baselines, Evaluations, and Analysis Crucially, the conventional orthographic form of MSA text is unvocalized, a property that results in a deficient graphical representation. To facilitate comparison with previous work, we exhaustively evaluate this grammar and two other parsing models when gold segmentation is assumed (ยง5). The basic word order is VSO, but SVO, VOS, and VO configurations are also possible.2 Nouns and verbs are created by selecting a consonantal root (usually triliteral or quadriliteral), which bears the semantic core, and adding affixes and diacritics. Manual annotation results in human in- terpretable grammars that can inform future tree- bank annotation decisions. pre-processing. Although the segmentation requirements for Arabic are not as extreme as those for Chinese, Arabic is written with certain cliticized prepositions, pronouns, and connectives connected to adjacent words. Despite their simplicity, uni- gram weights have been shown as an effective feature in segmentation models (Dyer, 2009).13 The joint parser/segmenter is compared to a pipeline that uses MADA (v3.0), a state-of-the-art Arabic segmenter, configured to replicate ATB segmentation (Habash and Rambow, 2005). Therefore, we only score guess/gold pairs with identical character yields, a condition that allows us to measure parsing, tagging, and segmentation accuracy by ignoring whitespace. Table 9 shows that MADA produces a high quality segmentation, and that the effect of cascading segmentation errors on parsing is only 1.92% F1. We have described grammar state splits that significantly improve parsing performance, catalogued parsing errors, and quantified the effect of segmentation errors. Parent
