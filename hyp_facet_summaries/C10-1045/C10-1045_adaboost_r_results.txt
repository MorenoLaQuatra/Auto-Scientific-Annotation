Finally, we show that in application settings, the absence of gold segmentation lowers parsing performance by 2–5% F1. of Arabic. The Berkeley parser gives state-of-the-art performance for all metrics. 6 Joint Segmentation and Parsing. But gold segmentation is not available in application settings, so a segmenter and parser are arranged in a pipeline. Segmentation errors cascade into the parsing phase, placing an artificial limit on parsing performance.

Table 9 shows that MADA produces a high quality segmentation, and that the effect of cascading segmentation errors on parsing is only 1.92% F1. By establishing significantly higher parsing baselines, we have shown that Arabic parsing performance is not as poor as previously thought, but remains much lower than English. We have described grammar state splits that significantly improve parsing performance, catalogued parsing errors, and quantified the effect of segmentation errors. 95
