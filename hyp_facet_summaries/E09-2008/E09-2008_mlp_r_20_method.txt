Foma: a finite-state compiler and library Foma is licensed under the GNU general public license: in keeping with traditions of free software, the distribution that includes the source code comes with a user manual and a library of examples. This makes it straightforward to build spell-checkers from morphological transducers by simply extracting the range of the transduction and matching words approximately. 10 } Here, instead of calling the fsm regex() function to construct the machine from a regular expressions, we could instead have accessed the beforementioned low-level routines and built the network entirely without regular expressions by combining low-level primitives, as follows, replacing line 5 in the above: network = fsm_concat( fsm_kleene_plus( fsm_symbol("a")), fsm_kleene_plus( fsm_symbol("b"))); The API is currently under active development and future functionality is likely to include conversion of networks to 8-bit letter transducers/automata for maximum speed in regular expression matching and transduction.
