Foma: a finite-state compiler and library Foma is largely compatible with the Xerox/PARC finite-state toolkit. This makes it straightforward to build spell-checkers from morphological transducers by simply extracting the range of the transduction and matching words approximately. Unicode (UTF8) is fully supported and is in fact the only encoding accepted by Foma. Ëœ $ $. As mentioned, Foma supports reading and writing of the LEXC file format, where morphological categories are divided into so-called continuation classes. The Foma API gives access to basic functions, such as constructing a finite-state machine from a regular expression provided as a string, performing a transduction, and exhaustively matching against a given string starting from every position. void check_word(char *s) { 2. printf("Regex matches"); 9. Foma is free software and will remain under the GNU General Public License. The others are scripts that can be run on both Xerox/PARC and Foma. if
