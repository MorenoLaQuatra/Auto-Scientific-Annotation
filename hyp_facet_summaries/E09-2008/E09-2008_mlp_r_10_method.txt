Foma: a finite-state compiler and library Foma is a compiler, programming language, and C library for constructing finite-state automata and transducers for various uses. Foma is largely compatible with the Xerox/PARC finite-state toolkit. Foma is licensed under the GNU general public license: in keeping with traditions of free software, the distribution that includes the source code comes with a user manual and a library of examples. This makes it straightforward to build spell-checkers from morphological transducers by simply extracting the range of the transduction and matching words approximately. Ëœ $ $. result = fsm_match(fsm, s); 7. if (result->num_matches > 0) 8. Table 2 shows a comparison with some existing toolkits that build deterministic, minimized automata/transducers. Several wide- coverage morphological analyzers specified in the LEXC/xfst format have been compiled successfully with Foma. The others are scripts that can be run on both Xerox/PARC and Foma.
