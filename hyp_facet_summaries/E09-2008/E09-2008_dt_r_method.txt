Foma: a finite-state compiler and library Ëœ $ $. One such extension is the ability to use of a form of first-order logic to make existential statements over languages and transductions (Hulden, 2008). Hence, in the above example, OneL defines the language where there exists a string x such that x is a member of the language L and there does not exist a string y, also in L, such that y would occur in a different position than x. This kind of logical specification of regular languages can be very useful for building some languages that would be quite cumbersome to express with other regular expression operators. printf("Regex matches"); 9. Operations such as unions of automata are also constructed by default with the product construction method that directly produces deterministic automata. The others are scripts that can be run on both Xerox/PARC and Foma. Horizontal lines
