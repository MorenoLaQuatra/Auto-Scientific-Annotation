Foma is largely compatible with the Xerox/PARC finite-state toolkit. Foma is licensed under the GNU general public license: in keeping with traditions of free software, the distribution that includes the source code comes with a user manual and a library of examples. This makes it straightforward to build spell-checkers from morphological transducers by simply extracting the range of the transduction and matching words approximately. The Foma API gives access to basic functions, such as constructing a finite-state machine from a regular expression provided as a string, performing a transduction, and exhaustively matching against a given string starting from every position. Though the main concern with Foma has not been that of efficiency, but of compatibility and extendibility, from a usefulness perspective it is important to avoid bottlenecks in the underlying algorithms that can cause compilation times to skyrocket, especially when constructing and combining large lexical transducers.
