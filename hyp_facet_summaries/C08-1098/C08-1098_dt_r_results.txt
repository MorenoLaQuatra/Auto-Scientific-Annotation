Table 3 shows the results of an evaluation based on the plain STTS tagset. The SVMTool is slightly better than the TnT tagger on the default tagset, but shows little improvement from the tagset refinement. 3 9 97.57 97.97 Table 3: STTS accuracies of the TnT tagger trained on the STTS tagset, the TnT tagger trained on the Tiger tagset, and our tagger trained on the Tiger tagset. 89 88.9 88.8 Provost & Domingos (2003) noted that well- known decision tree induction algorithms such as C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) or CART (Breiman et al., 1984) fail to produce accurate probability estimates. The tagging accuracy reported by Kempe was below that of a traditional trigram tagger. used. The German tagging results are, to the best of our knowledge, the first published results for fine- grained POS tagging with the Tiger tagset. (Is
