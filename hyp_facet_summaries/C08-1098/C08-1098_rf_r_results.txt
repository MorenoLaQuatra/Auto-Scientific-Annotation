The German Tiger treebank (Brants et al., 2002) is an example of a corpus with a more fine-grained tagset (over 700 tags overall). Our tagger was first evaluated on data from the German Tiger treebank. Table 3 shows the results of an evaluation based on the plain STTS tagset. The second row contains the results for the TnT tagger when it is trained on the Tiger data and the output is mapped to STTS. The TnT tagger achieves 86.3% accuracy on the default tagset. The SVMTool is slightly better than the TnT tagger on the default tagset, but shows little improvement from the tagset refinement. 3 9 97.57 97.97 Table 3: STTS accuracies of the TnT tagger trained on the STTS tagset, the TnT tagger trained on the Tiger tagset, and our tagger trained on the Tiger tagset. used.
