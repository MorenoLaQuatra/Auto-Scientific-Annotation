Estimation of Conditional ProbabilitiesWith Decision Trees and an Application to Fine-Grained POS Tagging It is based on three ideas: (1) splitting of the POS tags into attribute vectors and decomposition of the contextual POS probabilities of the HMM into a product of attribute probabilities, (2) estimation of the contextual probabilities with decision trees, and (3) use of high-order HMMs. (1) context prob. The backoff smoothing methods of traditional n-gram POS taggers require an ordering of the reduced contexts which is not available, here. Our tagger generates a predictor for each feature (such as base POS, number, gender etc.) Instead of using a single tree for the prediction of all possible values of a feature (such as noun, article, etc. for base POS), the tagger builds a separate decision tree for each value. To understand why, assume that there are three trees for the gender attributes. 8 In German, the genitive case of arguments is more and. A tag is considered correct if all attributes are correct. Apparently, the lexical features used by the SVMTool encode most of the information of the tagset refinement. By far the most frequent tagging error was the confusion of nominative and accusative case. 2
