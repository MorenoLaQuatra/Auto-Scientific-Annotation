(Neither does the pair consisting of the first two tags.) The non-terminal nodes are labeled with attribute tests, the edges with the possible outcomes of a test, and the terminal nodes are labeled with classes. To understand why, assume that there are three trees for the gender attributes. The weight of each subset is proportional to its size. The singular attribute of a noun and an adjective POS tag are therefore two different attributes.4 Each position in the POS tags of a given category corresponds to a feature. The Witten-Bell method is then applied to smooth the lexical probabilities with the average probabilities. a threshold of 1. Therefore it was not possible to optimize the parameters systematically. 5.1 Tiger Corpus. Examples are the nominal POS tags NN and NE which were mapped to N.Reg and N.Name. This strategy returned the best results on the development data. 8 In German, the genitive case of arguments is more and. A tag is considered correct if all attributes are correct. Hence there is no need to put aside training data for parameter tuning. The best accuracy of the TnT tagger was 88.2% with a maximal suffix length of 5. used. Relative to
