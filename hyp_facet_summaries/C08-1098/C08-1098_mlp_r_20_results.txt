Estimation of Conditional ProbabilitiesWith Decision Trees and an Application to Fine-Grained POS Tagging We present a HMM part-of-speech tagging method which is particularly suited for POS tagsets with a large number of fine-grained tags. For languages with a rich morphology such as German or Czech, more fine-grained tagsets are often considered more appropriate. The German Tiger treebank (Brants et al., 2002) is an example of a corpus with a more fine-grained tagset (over 700 tags overall). a threshold of 1. 3 9 97.57 97.97 Table 3: STTS accuracies of the TnT tagger trained on the STTS tagset, the TnT tagger trained on the Tiger tagset, and our tagger trained on the Tiger tagset. used. The German tagging results are, to the best of our knowledge, the first published results for fine- grained POS tagging with the Tiger tagset. 1 7
