Estimation of Conditional ProbabilitiesWith Decision Trees and an Application to Fine-Grained POS Tagging Tagsets of this size contain little or no information about number, gender, case and similar morphosyntac- tic features. For languages with a rich morphology such as German or Czech, more fine-grained tagsets are often considered more appropriate. (1) context prob. Qc 2008. In a second step, the decision tree may be pruned in order to avoid overfit- ting to the training data. 4.1 Supplementary Lexicon. Decreasing their number to 4 turned out to be better. Examples are the nominal POS tags NN and NE which were mapped to N.Reg and N.Name. Note that only the words, but not the POS tags from the test and development data were used, here. Therefore, it is always possible to create a supplementary lexicon for the corpus to be processed. a
