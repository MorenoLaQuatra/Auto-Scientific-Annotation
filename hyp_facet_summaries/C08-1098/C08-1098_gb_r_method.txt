Estimation of Conditional ProbabilitiesWith Decision Trees and an Application to Fine-Grained POS Tagging It is based on three ideas: (1) splitting of the POS tags into attribute vectors and decomposition of the contextual POS probabilities of the HMM into a product of attribute probabilities, (2) estimation of the contextual probabilities with decision trees, and (3) use of high-order HMMs. (Neither does the pair consisting of the first two tags.) Thus, the agreement between the article and the adjective is not checked anymore. Decision trees are ideal for this task because the identification of relevant attribute combinations is at the heart of this method. Our tagger generates a predictor for each feature (such as base POS, number, gender etc.) Instead of using a single tree for the prediction of all possible values of a feature (such as noun, article, etc. for base POS), the tagger builds a separate decision tree for each value. To understand why, assume that there are three trees for the gender attributes. This mapping is unambiguous. The tagging accuracy reported by Kempe was below that of a traditional trigram tagger. used. A hybrid system based on four different tagging methods reached an accuracy of 95.68%. 4
