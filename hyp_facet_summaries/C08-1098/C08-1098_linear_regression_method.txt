It is based on three ideas: (1) splitting of the POS tags into attribute vectors and decomposition of the contextual POS probabilities of the HMM into a product of attribute probabilities, (2) estimation of the contextual probabilities with decision trees, and (3) use of high-order HMMs. Tagsets of this size contain little or no information about number, gender, case and similar morphosyntac- tic features. Because of the lack of gender agreement between das (neuter) and the noun RealitaÂ¨ t (feminine), the article reading must be wrong. (1) context prob. (Neither does the pair consisting of the first two tags.) Our tagger generates a predictor for each feature (such as base POS, number, gender etc.) Instead of using a single tree for the prediction of all possible values of a feature (such as noun, article, etc. for base POS), the tagger builds a separate decision tree for each value. To understand why, assume that there are three trees for the gender attributes. This could be due to the higher rate of unknown words (10.0% vs. 7.7%). Schmid (1994) and Ma`rquez (1999) used decision trees for the estimation of contextual tag probabilities, but without a decomposition of the tag probability. By
