Estimation of Conditional ProbabilitiesWith Decision Trees and an Application to Fine-Grained POS Tagging We present a HMM part-of-speech tagging method which is particularly suited for POS tagsets with a large number of fine-grained tags. For languages with a rich morphology such as German or Czech, more fine-grained tagsets are often considered more appropriate. The German Tiger treebank (Brants et al., 2002) is an example of a corpus with a more fine-grained tagset (over 700 tags overall). The SVMTool is slightly better than the TnT tagger on the default tagset, but shows little improvement from the tagset refinement. 3 9 97.57 97.97 Table 3: STTS accuracies of the TnT tagger trained on the STTS tagset, the TnT tagger trained on the Tiger tagset, and our tagger trained on the Tiger tagset. Table 4 shows the performance on the test data. 1
