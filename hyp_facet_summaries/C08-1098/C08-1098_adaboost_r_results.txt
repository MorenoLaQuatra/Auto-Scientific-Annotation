The first result was obtained with TnT trained on Tiger data which was mapped to STTS before. The second row contains the results for the TnT tagger when it is trained on the Tiger data and the output is mapped to STTS. The TnT tagger achieves 86.3% accuracy on the default tagset. The SVMTool is slightly better than the TnT tagger on the default tagset, but shows little improvement from the tagset refinement. 3 9 97.57 97.97 Table 3: STTS accuracies of the TnT tagger trained on the STTS tagset, the TnT tagger trained on the Tiger tagset, and our tagger trained on the Tiger tagset. The corresponding figures for the test data are. used. The German tagging results are, to the best of our knowledge, the first published results for fine- grained POS tagging with the Tiger tagset. A
