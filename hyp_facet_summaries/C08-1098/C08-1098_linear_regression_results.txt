For languages with a rich morphology such as German or Czech, more fine-grained tagsets are often considered more appropriate. The German Tiger treebank (Brants et al., 2002) is an example of a corpus with a more fine-grained tagset (over 700 tags overall). Qc 2008. The SVMTool is slightly better than the TnT tagger on the default tagset, but shows little improvement from the tagset refinement. With a context of two preceding POS tags (similar to the trigram tagger TnT), our tagger outperforms TnT by 0.7% on the default tagset, by 1% on the refined tagset, and by 1.1% on the refined tagset plus the additional lexicon. 3 9 97.57 97.97 Table 3: STTS accuracies of the TnT tagger trained on the STTS tagset, the TnT tagger trained on the Tiger tagset, and our tagger trained on the Tiger tagset.
