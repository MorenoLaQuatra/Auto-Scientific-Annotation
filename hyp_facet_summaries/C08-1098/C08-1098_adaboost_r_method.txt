Estimation of Conditional ProbabilitiesWith Decision Trees and an Application to Fine-Grained POS Tagging It is based on three ideas: (1) splitting of the POS tags into attribute vectors and decomposition of the contextual POS probabilities of the HMM into a product of attribute probabilities, (2) estimation of the contextual probabilities with decision trees, and (3) use of high-order HMMs. Tagsets of this size contain little or no information about number, gender, case and similar morphosyntac- tic features. (Neither does the pair consisting of the first two tags.) Our tagger generates a predictor for each feature (such as base POS, number, gender etc.) Instead of using a single tree for the prediction of all possible values of a feature (such as noun, article, etc. for base POS), the tagger builds a separate decision tree for each value. To understand why, assume that there are three trees for the gender attributes. It is annotated with POS tags from the coarse-grained STTS tagset and with additional features encoding information about number, gender, case, person, degree, tense, and mood. Schmid (1994) and Ma`rquez (1999) used decision trees for the estimation of contextual tag probabilities, but without a decomposition of the tag probability. By
