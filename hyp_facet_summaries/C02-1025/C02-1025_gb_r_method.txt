Named Entity Recognition: A Maximum Entropy Approach Using Global Information Mikheev et al. The zone to which a token belongs is used as a feature. Case and Zone: If the token starts with a capital letter (initCaps), then an additional feature (init- Caps, zone) is set to 1. If it is made up of all capital letters, then (allCaps, zone) is set to 1. Case and Zone of and : Similarly, if (or ) is initCaps, a feature (initCaps, zone) (or (initCaps, zone) ) is set to 1, etc. Token Information: This group consists of 10 features based on the string , as listed in Table 1. Lexicon Feature of Previous and Next Token: The string of the previous token and the next token is used with the initCaps information of . If has initCaps, then a feature (initCaps, ) is set to 1. For all lists except locations, the lists are processed into a list of tokens (unigrams). Only tokens with initCaps not found in commonWords are tested against each list in Table 2. Note that we check for , the word preceding the consecutive sequence of initCaps tokens, since person prefixes like Mr., Dr., etc are not part of person names, whereas corporate suffixes like Corp., Inc., etc are part of corporate names. For a word whose initCaps might be due to its position rather than its meaning (in headlines, first word of a sentence, etc), the case information of other occurrences might be more accurate than its own. needs to be in initCaps to be considered for this feature. If is unique, then a feature (Unique, Zone) is set to 1, where Zone is the document zone where appears. ‚Äù).
