Named Entity Recognition: A Maximum Entropy Approach Using Global Information In this paper, we show that the maximum entropy framework is able to make use of global information directly, and achieves performance that is comparable to the best previous machine learning-based NERs on MUC6 and MUC7 test data. 4.1 Local Features. ‚Äù).
