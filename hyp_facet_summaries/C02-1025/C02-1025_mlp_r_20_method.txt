Named Entity Recognition: A Maximum Entropy Approach Using Global Information We propose maximizing , where is the sequence of named- entity tags assigned to the words in the sentence , and is the information that can be extracted from the whole document containing . Our system is built on a maximum entropy classifier. The zone to which a token belongs is used as a feature. Case and Zone: If the token starts with a capital letter (initCaps), then an additional feature (init- Caps, zone) is set to 1. Case and Zone of and : Similarly, if (or ) is initCaps, a feature (initCaps, zone) (or (initCaps, zone) ) is set to 1, etc. Token Information: This group consists of 10 features based on the string , as listed in Table 1. Lexicon Feature of Previous and Next Token: The string of the previous token and the next token is used with the initCaps information of . If has initCaps, then a feature (initCaps, ) is set to 1. For all lists except locations, the lists are processed into a list of tokens (unigrams). Note that we check for , the word preceding the consecutive sequence of initCaps tokens, since person prefixes like Mr., Dr., etc are not part of person names, whereas corporate suffixes like Corp., Inc., etc are part of corporate names. For a word whose initCaps might be due to its position rather than its meaning (in headlines, first word of a sentence, etc), the case information of other occurrences might be more accurate than its own. ‚Äù). If is unique, then a feature (Unique, Zone) is set to 1, where Zone is the document zone where appears. of Tokens MENERGI
