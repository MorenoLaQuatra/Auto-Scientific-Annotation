Case and Zone: If the token starts with a capital letter (initCaps), then an additional feature (init- Caps, zone) is set to 1. Case and Zone of and : Similarly, if (or ) is initCaps, a feature (initCaps, zone) (or (initCaps, zone) ) is set to 1, etc. Token Information: This group consists of 10 features based on the string , as listed in Table 1. Lexicon Feature of Previous and Next Token: The string of the previous token and the next token is used with the initCaps information of . If has initCaps, then a feature (initCaps, ) is set to 1. For all lists except locations, the lists are processed into a list of tokens (unigrams). Note that we check for , the word preceding the consecutive sequence of initCaps tokens, since person prefixes like Mr., Dr., etc are not part of person names, whereas corporate suffixes like Corp., Inc., etc are part of corporate names. For a word whose initCaps might be due to its position rather than its meaning (in headlines, first word of a sentence, etc), the case information of other occurrences might be more accurate than its own. ‚Äù). If is unique, then a feature (Unique, Zone) is set to 1, where Zone is the document zone where appears. As each global feature group is added to the list of features, we see improvements to both MUC6 and MUC6 MUC7 Baseline 90.75% 85.22% + ICOC 91.50% 86.24% + CSPP 92.89% 86.96% + ACRO 93.04% 86.99% + SOIC 93.25% 87.22% + UNIQ 93.27% 87.24% Table 3: F-measure after successive addition of each global feature group Table 5: Comparison of results for MUC6 Systems MUC6 MUC7 No. Mikheev et
