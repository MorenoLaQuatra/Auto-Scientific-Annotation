Named Entity Recognition: A Maximum Entropy Approach Using Global Information Case and Zone: If the token starts with a capital letter (initCaps), then an additional feature (init- Caps, zone) is set to 1. Lexicon Feature of Previous and Next Token: The string of the previous token and the next token is used with the initCaps information of . If has initCaps, then a feature (initCaps, ) is set to 1. For all lists except locations, the lists are processed into a list of tokens (unigrams). Note that we check for , the word preceding the consecutive sequence of initCaps tokens, since person prefixes like Mr., Dr., etc are not part of person names, whereas corporate suffixes like Corp., Inc., etc are part of corporate names. The global feature groups are: InitCaps of Other Occurrences (ICOC): There are 2 features in this group, checking for whether the first occurrence of the same word in an unambiguous position (non first-words in the TXT or TEXT zones) in the same document is initCaps or not-initCaps. ‚Äù). needs to be in initCaps to be considered for this feature. If is unique, then a feature (Unique, Zone) is set to 1, where Zone is the document zone where appears. The effect of UNIQ is very small on both data sets. In MUC6, the best result is achieved by SRA (Krupka, 1995). The effect of a second reference resolution classifier is not entirely the same as that of global features. Such a classification can be seen as a not-always-correct summary of global features. Hence we decided to restrict ourselves to only information from the same document. Information from a sentence is sometimes insufficient to classify a name correctly. MUC7
