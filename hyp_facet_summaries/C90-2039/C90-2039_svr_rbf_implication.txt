In such unification-based formalisms, feature ~trueture (FS) unification is the most fundamental and ..~ignifieant operation. Ile proposed an incremental copy graph unification method to avoid over copying and early copying. An extension allows complex FSs to have type symbols which define a lattice structure on them, for example, as in [Pollard and Sag 8"11. Otherwise, the procedure obtains the output node with the meet as its TYPESYMBOL. Next, the procedure treats arcs. The procedure assumes the existence of two procedures, namely, SharedArcs and ComplementArcs. Next, the procedure treats arcs obtained by ComplementArcs. 6). ELSE AddArc(newnode, arc.label, arc.value). 4.
