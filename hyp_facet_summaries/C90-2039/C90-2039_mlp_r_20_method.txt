Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification This is impossible in straightforward unification-based formalisms. That is, an FS unification method is proposed that introduces a strategy called the e_arly failure Â£inding strategy (the EFF strategy) to make FS unification efficient, in this method, FS unification orders are not specified explicitly by rule wril.ers, but are controlled by learned information on tendencies of FS constraint application failures. 1. 2. 3. 4. The SharedArcs procedure takes two lists of arcs as its arguments and gives two lists of arcs each of which contains arcs whose labels exists in both lists with the same arc label order. 5. node2 = Dereferencelnode2). (sharedst, shareds2) = SharedArcs(nodel.arcs, node2.arcs). complements1 = ComplementArcs(node|.arcs, node2.arcs). complements2 = ComplementArcs(node2.arcs, nodel.arcs). Return(outnode). 6). That is, antecedent nodes in the COPY-DEPENDENCY values are also copied. ENDIF Returo(newnode). The
