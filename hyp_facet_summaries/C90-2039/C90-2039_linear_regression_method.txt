For example, when constructing a phrase structure from its parts (e.g., a sentence fi'om a subject NP and VP), unueeessary computation can be reduced if the semantic representation is assembled after checking constraints such as grammatical agreements, which can fail. In contrast, in a procedure-based system which uses IF-TItEN style rules (i.e., consisting of explicit test and structure-building operations), it is possible to construct the semantic representation (TIIEN par'g) after checking the agreement (IF part). The SharedArcs procedure takes two lists of arcs as its arguments and gives two lists of arcs each of which contains arcs whose labels exists in both lists with the same arc label order. Return(outnode). That is, antecedent nodes in the COPY-DEPENDENCY values are also copied. Return(Nil_). Unlike the analysis case, unification of features for semantic representations tends to fail.
