3. The unification procedure is applied recursively to feature a values of the input nodes. This is because such subgraphs can be modified later. ELSE meet = Meet(nodel.typesymbol, node2.typesymbol) IF Equal?(meet, Bottom) THEN Return(Bottom). (sharedst, shareds2) = SharedArcs(nodel.arcs, node2.arcs). complements2 = ComplementArcs(node2.arcs, nodel.arcs). In Section 5, a method which uses this generalized strategy is proposed. It substitutes arcs with newly copied nodes for existing arcs. The efficiency of the SING unification method depends on the following factors: (1) The overall FS unification failure rate of the process: in extreme cases, if Go unification failure occurs, the method has no advantages except the overhead of feature unification order sorting. Furthermore, structure sharing increases the portion of token identical substructures of FSs which makes it efficient to keep unification results of substructures of FSs and reuse them. In
