Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification In such unification-based formalisms, feature ~trueture (FS) unification is the most fundamental and ..~ignifieant operation. In natural language processing, such cases are ubiquitous. has as its value a TFS which is not less than its counterpart in tl ; and each of the coreference relationships in t2 is also held in tl. The procedure assumes the existence of two procedures, namely, SharedArcs and ComplementArcs. 6). ELSE IF NotEmpty?(newarcs = CopyArcs(node)) THEN newnode = Create(node.typesymbol). ENDIF Returo(newnode). ENDIF Return(newarcs). The arc pairs obtained by the SharedArcs procedure are sorted before treating arcs. For
