The strategic lazy incremental copy graph unification method is a combination of two methods for unifying hmture structures. One, called the lazy incremental copy graph unification method, achieves structure sharing with constant order data access time which reduces the cequired memory. These formalisms were applied in the field of natural language processing and, based on these formalisms, ~:~ystems such as machine translation systems were developed [l<ol;u, e et a l 8gJ. TFSs are very convenient for describing linguistic information in unlfication-based formalisms. Next, the procedure treats arcs. node2 = Dereferencelnode2). Return(Nil_). This reduces repeated calculation of substructures. ENDIF
