Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification One, called the lazy incremental copy graph unification method, achieves structure sharing with constant order data access time which reduces the cequired memory. Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying. In contrast, in a procedure-based system which uses IF-TItEN style rules (i.e., consisting of explicit test and structure-building operations), it is possible to construct the semantic representation (TIIEN par'g) after checking the agreement (IF part). 1. Next, the procedure treats arcs. The SharedArcs procedure takes two lists of arcs as its arguments and gives two lists of arcs each of which contains arcs whose labels exists in both lists with the same arc label order. That is, antecedent nodes in the COPY-DEPENDENCY values are also copied. Unlike the analysis case, unification of features for semantic representations tends to fail. 6).
