Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification 3. The SharedArcs procedure takes two lists of arcs as its arguments and gives two lists of arcs each of which contains arcs whose labels exists in both lists with the same arc label order. 5. node2 = Dereferencelnode2). (sharedst, shareds2) = SharedArcs(nodel.arcs, node2.arcs). complements1 = ComplementArcs(node|.arcs, node2.arcs). complements2 = ComplementArcs(node2.arcs, nodel.arcs). 5, the subgraphs of the result DG surrounded by the dashed rectangle can be shared with subgraphs of input structures G1 and G2, Section 4 proposes a method t.hat avoids this problem, Wroblewski's method first treats arcs with labels that exist in both input nodes and then treats arcs with unique labels. That is, antecedent nodes in the COPY-DEPENDENCY values are also copied. Return(Nil_). Unlike the analysis case, unification of features for semantic representations tends to fail. 1.
