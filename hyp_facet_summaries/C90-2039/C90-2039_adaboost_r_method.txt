Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification In contrast, in a procedure-based system which uses IF-TItEN style rules (i.e., consisting of explicit test and structure-building operations), it is possible to construct the semantic representation (TIIEN par'g) after checking the agreement (IF part). TFSs are denoted by feature-value pair matrices or rooted directed graphs as shown in Fig. The SharedArcs procedure takes two lists of arcs as its arguments and gives two lists of arcs each of which contains arcs whose labels exists in both lists with the same arc label order. That is, antecedent nodes in the COPY-DEPENDENCY values are also copied. For example, when unification of features for case markers does fail, treating these features first avoids treating features for senmntic representations. Unlike the analysis case, unification of features for semantic representations tends to fail. The
