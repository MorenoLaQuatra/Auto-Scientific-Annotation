Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification One, called the lazy incremental copy graph unification method, achieves structure sharing with constant order data access time which reduces the cequired memory. In contrast, in a procedure-based system which uses IF-TItEN style rules (i.e., consisting of explicit test and structure-building operations), it is possible to construct the semantic representation (TIIEN par'g) after checking the agreement (IF part). 3. 4. ELSE meet = Meet(nodel.typesymbol, node2.typesymbol) IF Equal?(meet, Bottom) THEN Return(Bottom). IF Equal?(arcnode, Bottom) ]HEN Return(Bottom). That is, antecedent nodes in the COPY-DEPENDENCY values are also copied. The efficiency of the SING unification method depends on the following factors: (1) The overall FS unification failure rate of the process: in extreme cases, if Go unification failure occurs, the method has no advantages except the overhead of feature unification order sorting. 5.
