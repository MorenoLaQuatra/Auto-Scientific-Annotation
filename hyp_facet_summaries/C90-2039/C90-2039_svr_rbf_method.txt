Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification Wroblewski claims that copying is wrong when an algorithm copies too much (over copying) or copies too soon (early copying). Ile proposed an incremental copy graph unification method to avoid over copying and early copying. In Kasper's disjunctive feature description unification [Kasper 861, such cases occur very h'equently in unifying definite and disjunct's definite parts. An example of a type symbol lattice is shown in Fig. 3. 4. This is achieved by the sorting procedure of common label arc pairs attached to the meet type symbol. The efficiency of the SING unification method depends on the following factors: (1) The overall FS unification failure rate of the process: in extreme cases, if Go unification failure occurs, the method has no advantages except the overhead of feature unification order sorting. node.copy
