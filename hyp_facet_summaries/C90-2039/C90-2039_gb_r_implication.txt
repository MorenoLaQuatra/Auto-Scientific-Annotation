Strategic Lazy Incremental Copy Graph Unification TFSs are very convenient for describing linguistic information in unlfication-based formalisms. Otherwise, the procedure obtains the output node with the meet as its TYPESYMBOL. Next, the procedure treats arcs. The procedure assumes the existence of two procedures, namely, SharedArcs and ComplementArcs. Next, the procedure treats arcs obtained by ComplementArcs. AddArc(outnode, complement.label, newnode). 5 due to a change of node Y G3/<a c g>). To achieve this, I, he LING unification method, which uses copy dependency information, was developed. The arc pairs obtained by the SharedArcs procedure are sorted before treating arcs. 1.
