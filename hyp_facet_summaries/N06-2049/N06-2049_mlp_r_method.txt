We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation. 1. It is composed of three parts: a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging.

Its calculation is defined as: C M(tiob |w) = αC Miob (tiob |w) + (1 − α)δ(tw , tiob )ng (2) where tiob is the word w’s IOB tag assigned by the IOB tagging; tw , a prior IOB tag determined by the results of the dictionary-based segmentation. If the value was lower than t, the IOB tag was rejected and the dictionary-based segmentation was used; otherwise, the IOB tagging segmentation was used. 3.2 Effect of the confidence measure. In section 2.2, we proposed a confidence measure approach to reevaluate the results of IOB tagging by combinations of the results of the dictionary-based segmentation. We found the results in Table 3 were better than those in Table 2 and Table 1, which prove that using confidence measure approach achieved the best performance over the dictionary-based segmentation and the IOB tagging approach.
