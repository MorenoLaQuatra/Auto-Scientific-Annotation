In this work we propose a confidence measure approach to lessen the weakness. 1. It is composed of three parts: a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging. Since the dictionary-based approach is a well-known method, we skip its technical descriptions. If the subset consists of Chinese characters only, it is a character-based IOB tagger. We regard the words in the subset as the subwords for the IOB tagging. 2.2 Confidence-dependent word segmentation. We define a confidence measure, C M(tiob |w), to measure the confidence of the results produced by the IOB tagging by using the results from the dictionary-based segmentation. The confidence measure comes from two sources: IOB tagging and dictionary- based word segmentation. After the dictionary- based word segmentation, the words are re-segmented into subwords by FMM before being fed to IOB tagging. By Eq. 2 the results of IOB tagging were reevaluated. For the dictionary-based approach, we extracted a word list from the training data as the vocabulary. 71 6 0.9 64 0.9 72 Table 2: Segmentation results by a pure subword-based IOB tagging. There were no F-score changes for AS and PKU corpora, but the recall rates were improved. Comparing Table 1 and 2, we found the CRF-modeled IOB tagging yielded better segmentation than the dictionary- based approach. 3.2 Effect of the confidence measure. It was first used in Chinese word segmentation by (Xue and Shen, 2003), where maximum entropy methods were used. We proved the new approach enhanced the word segmentation significantly. Another advantage of the word-based IOB tagging over the character-based is its speed. 60
