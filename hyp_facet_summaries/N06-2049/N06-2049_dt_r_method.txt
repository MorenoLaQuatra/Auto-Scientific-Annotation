Subword-based Tagging by Conditional Random Fields for Chinese Word Segmentation While OOV recognition is very important in word segmentation, a higher IV rate is also desired. If the subset consists of Chinese characters only, it is a character-based IOB tagger. We did not conduct comparative experiments because trivial differences of these approaches may not result in significant consequences to the subword-based ap proach. We define a confidence measure, C M(tiob |w), to measure the confidence of the results produced by the IOB tagging by using the results from the dictionary-based segmentation. The confidence measure comes from two sources: IOB tagging and dictionary- based word segmentation. Its calculation is defined as: C M(tiob |w) = αC Miob (tiob |w) + (1 − α)δ(tw , tiob )ng (2) where tiob is the word w’s IOB tag assigned by the IOB tagging; tw , a prior IOB tag determined by the results of the dictionary-based segmentation. After the dictionary- based word segmentation, the words are re-segmented into subwords by FMM before being fed to IOB tagging. If the value was lower than t, the IOB tag was rejected and the dictionary-based segmentation was used; otherwise, the IOB tagging segmentation was used. In a real application, a satisfactory tradeoff between R- ivs and R-oovs could find through tuning the confidence threshold. In Section 3.2 we will present the experimental segmentation results of the confidence measure approach. 71 6 0.9 64 0.9 72 Table 2: Segmentation results by a pure subword-based IOB tagging. There were no F-score changes for AS and PKU corpora, but the recall rates were improved. Comparing Table 1 and 2, we found the CRF-modeled IOB tagging yielded better segmentation than the dictionary- based approach. 3.2 Effect of the confidence measure. In
