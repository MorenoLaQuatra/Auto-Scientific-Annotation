We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach. We found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging. While OOV recognition is very important in word segmentation, a higher IV rate is also desired. Our word segmentation process is illustrated in Fig. 2.1 Subword-based IOB tagging using CRFs. The confidence measure comes from two sources: IOB tagging and dictionary- based word segmentation. After the dictionary- based word segmentation, the words are re-segmented into subwords by FMM before being fed to IOB tagging. By Eq. 2 the results of IOB tagging were reevaluated. In a real application, a satisfactory tradeoff between R- ivs and R-oovs could find through tuning the confidence threshold. In Section 3.2 we will present the experimental segmentation results of the confidence measure approach. We used the data provided by Sighan Bakeoff 2005 to test our approaches described in the previous sections. Hence, this approach produced lower F-scores. For the subword-based tagging, we added another 2000 most frequent multiple- character words to the lexicons for tagging. The segmentation results using CRF tagging are shown in Table 2, where the upper numbers of each slot were produced by the character-based approach while the lower numbers were of the subword-based. 60 7 0. We proved the new approach enhanced the word segmentation significantly. The idea of using the confidence measure has appeared in (Peng and McCallum, 2004), where it was used to recognize the OOVs. By way of the confidence measure we combined results from the dictionary-based and the IOB-tagging-based and as a result, we could achieve the optimal performance. This approach is effective for performing desired segmentation based on usersâ€™ requirements to R-oov and R-iv. Section
