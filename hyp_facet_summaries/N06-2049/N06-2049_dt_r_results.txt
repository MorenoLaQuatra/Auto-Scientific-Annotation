If only Chinese characters are used, the subword-based IOB tagging is downgraded into a character-based one. It is composed of three parts: a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging. The subscripts are position indicators. If the value was lower than t, the IOB tag was rejected and the dictionary-based segmentation was used; otherwise, the IOB tagging segmentation was used. Five metrics were used to evaluate segmentation results: recall(R), precision(P), F-score(F), OOV rate(R-oov) and IV rate(R-iv). However, the R-iv rates were getting worse in return for higher R-oov rates. Even with the use of confidence measure, the word- based IOB tagging still outperformed the character-based IOB tagging. Our approaches produced wrong segmentations for labeling inconsistency. Another advantage of the word-based IOB tagging over the character-based is its speed. We
