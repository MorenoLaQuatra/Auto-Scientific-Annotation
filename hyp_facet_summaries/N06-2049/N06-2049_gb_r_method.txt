We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach. In this work we propose a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters. In this work we propose a confidence measure approach to lessen the weakness. 1. It is composed of three parts: a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging. We define a confidence measure, C M(tiob |w), to measure the confidence of the results produced by the IOB tagging by using the results from the dictionary-based segmentation. The confidence measure comes from two sources: IOB tagging and dictionary- based word segmentation. After the dictionary- based word segmentation, the words are re-segmented into subwords by FMM before being fed to IOB tagging. In Section 3.2 we will present the experimental segmentation results of the confidence measure approach. Comparing Table 1 and 2, we found the CRF-modeled IOB tagging yielded better segmentation than the dictionary- based approach. In section 2.2, we proposed a confidence measure approach to reevaluate the results of IOB tagging by combinations of the results of the dictionary-based segmentation. We found the results in Table 3 were better than those in Table 2 and Table 1, which prove that using confidence measure approach achieved the best performance over the dictionary-based segmentation and the IOB tagging approach. In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation. We also successfully employed the confidence measure to make a confidence-dependent word segmentation. 74
