In this work we propose a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters. 1. We define a confidence measure, C M(tiob |w), to measure the confidence of the results produced by the IOB tagging by using the results from the dictionary-based segmentation. The confidence measure comes from two sources: IOB tagging and dictionary- based word segmentation. After the dictionary- based word segmentation, the words are re-segmented into subwords by FMM before being fed to IOB tagging. 71 6 0.9 64 0.9 72 Table 2: Segmentation results by a pure subword-based IOB tagging. Comparing Table 1 and 2, we found the CRF-modeled IOB tagging yielded better segmentation than the dictionary- based approach. 3.2 Effect of the confidence measure. In section 2.2, we proposed a confidence measure approach to reevaluate the results of IOB tagging by combinations of the results of the dictionary-based segmentation. The effect of the confidence measure is shown in Table 3, where we used Î± = 0.7 and confidence threshold t = 0.8. We found the results in Table 3 were better than those in Table 2 and Table 1, which prove that using confidence measure approach achieved the best performance over the dictionary-based segmentation and the IOB tagging approach. Even with the use of confidence measure, the word- based IOB tagging still outperformed the character-based IOB tagging. By way of the confidence measure we combined results from the dictionary-based and the IOB-tagging-based and as a result, we could achieve the optimal performance. In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation. We also successfully employed the confidence measure to make a confidence-dependent word segmentation. We
