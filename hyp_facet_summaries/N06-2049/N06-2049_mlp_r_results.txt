Subword-based Tagging by Conditional Random Fields for Chinese Word Segmentation We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach. We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation. We found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging. In addition, we found a clear weakness with the IOB tagging approach: It yields a very low in-vocabulary (IV) rate (R-iv) in return for a higher out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate (R-oov). 1. It is composed of three parts: a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging. However, the R-iv rates were getting worse in return for higher R-oov rates. 95 2 0. Each
