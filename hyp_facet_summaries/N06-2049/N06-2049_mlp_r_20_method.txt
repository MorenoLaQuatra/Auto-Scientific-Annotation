We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation. 1.

If the value was lower than t, the IOB tag was rejected and the dictionary-based segmentation was used; otherwise, the IOB tagging segmentation was used. Table 1 shows the performance of the dictionary-based segmentation. 3.2 Effect of the confidence measure. 74
