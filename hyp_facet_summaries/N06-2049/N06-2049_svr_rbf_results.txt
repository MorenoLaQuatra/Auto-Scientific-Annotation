We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach. In addition, the latter can be used to balance out-of-vocabulary rates and in-vocabulary rates. This approach will be described in Section 2.2. 1. In this section we introduce a confidence measure approach to combine the two results. After the dictionary- based word segmentation, the words are re-segmented into subwords by FMM before being fed to IOB tagging. A new OOV was thus created.

It was first used in Chinese word segmentation by (Xue and Shen, 2003), where maximum entropy methods were used. We proved the new approach enhanced the word segmentation significantly. We achieved the highest F-scores in CITYU, PKU and MSR corpora. This approach is effective for performing desired segmentation based on usersâ€™ requirements to R-oov and R-iv. In fact,
