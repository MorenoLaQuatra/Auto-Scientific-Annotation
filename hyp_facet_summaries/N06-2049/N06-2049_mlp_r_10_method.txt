Subword-based Tagging by Conditional Random Fields for Chinese Word Segmentation We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach. We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation. It is composed of three parts: a dictionary-based N-gram word segmentation for segmenting IV words, a subword- based tagging by the CRF for recognizing OOVs, and a confidence-dependent word segmentation used for merging the results of both the dictionary-based and the IOB tagging. The confidence measure comes from two sources: IOB tagging and dictionary- based word segmentation. If the value was lower than t, the IOB tag was rejected and the dictionary-based segmentation was used; otherwise, the IOB tagging segmentation was used. For detailed info. Table 1 shows the performance of the dictionary-based segmentation. In section 2.2, we proposed a confidence measure approach to reevaluate the results of IOB tagging by combinations of the results of the dictionary-based segmentation. We found the results in Table 3 were better than those in Table 2 and Table 1, which prove that using confidence measure approach achieved the best performance over the dictionary-based segmentation and the IOB tagging approach. Even with the use of confidence measure, the word- based IOB tagging still outperformed the character-based IOB tagging. It proves the proposed word-based IOB tagging was very effective. By way of the confidence measure we combined results from the dictionary-based and the IOB-tagging-based and as a result, we could achieve the optimal performance. In this work, we proposed a subword-based IOB tagging method for Chinese word segmentation. We also successfully employed the confidence measure to make a confidence-dependent word segmentation. Each
