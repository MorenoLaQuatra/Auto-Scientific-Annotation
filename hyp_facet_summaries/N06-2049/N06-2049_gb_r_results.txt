Subword-based Tagging by Conditional Random Fields for Chinese Word Segmentation We proposed two approaches to improve Chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach. We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation. We found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging. 1. If the value was lower than t, the IOB tag was rejected and the dictionary-based segmentation was used; otherwise, the IOB tagging segmentation was used. Five metrics were used to evaluate segmentation results: recall(R), precision(P), F-score(F), OOV rate(R-oov) and IV rate(R-iv). Table 1 shows the performance of the dictionary-based segmentation. However, the R-iv rates were getting worse in return for higher R-oov rates. In section 2.2, we proposed a confidence measure approach to reevaluate the results of IOB tagging by combinations of the results of the dictionary-based segmentation. 74 1
