Discovering Corpus-Specific Word Senses This paper presents an unsupervised algorithm which automatically discovers word senses from text. Following the method in (Widdows and Dorow, 2002), we build a graph in which each node represents a noun and two nodes have an edge between them if they co-occur in lists more than a given number of times 1. The word sense clustering algorithm as outlined below can be applied to any kind of similarity measure based on any set of features. section 2) for our experiment. Here we only mention a few direct results of our work. e.g.
