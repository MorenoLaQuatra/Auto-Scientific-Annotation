Discovering Corpus-Specific Word Senses This paper presents an unsupervised algorithm which automatically discovers word senses from text. section 4).. e.g. 4. 7. We used the simple graph model based on co-occurrences of nouns in lists (cf. An extract of the results is listed in table 1. Here we only mention a few direct results of our work. This gives rise to an automatic, unsupervised word sense disambiguation algorithm which is trained on the data to be disambiguated. section 2), and we plan to evaluate the uses of our clustering algorithm for unsupervised disambiguation more thoroughly.
