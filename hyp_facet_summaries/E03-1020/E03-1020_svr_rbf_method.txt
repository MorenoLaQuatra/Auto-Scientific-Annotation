e.g. The following notation and description of the MCL algorithm borrows heavily from van Dongen (2000). In case of homonymy, a small inflation parameter r would be appropriate. However, there are ambiguous words with more closely related senses which are metaphorical or metonymic variations of one another. Instead, in each step of the iterative process, we try to find the most disctinctive cluster c of G w (i.e. the most distinctive meaning of w) only. The class-labelling (step 6) is accomplished using the taxonomic structure of WordNet, using a robust algorithm developed specially for this purpose. Our
