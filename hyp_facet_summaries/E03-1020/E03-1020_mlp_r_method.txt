Discovering Corpus-Specific Word Senses This paper presents an unsupervised algorithm which automatically discovers word senses from text. Following the method in (Widdows and Dorow, 2002), we build a graph in which each node represents a noun and two nodes have an edge between them if they co-occur in lists more than a given number of times 1. e.g. 7. We used the simple graph model based on co-occurrences of nouns in lists (cf. section 2) for our experiment. section 2), and we plan to evaluate the uses of our clustering algorithm for unsupervised disambiguation more thoroughly. 41=0
