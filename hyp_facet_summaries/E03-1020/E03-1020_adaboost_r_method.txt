Discovering Corpus-Specific Word Senses Following the method in (Widdows and Dorow, 2002), we build a graph in which each node represents a noun and two nodes have an edge between them if they co-occur in lists more than a given number of times 1. (Kilgarriff, 1992)). 7. Here we only mention a few direct results of our work. This gives rise to an automatic, unsupervised word sense disambiguation algorithm which is trained on the data to be disambiguated. section 2), and we plan to evaluate the uses of our clustering algorithm for unsupervised disambiguation more thoroughly. Let
